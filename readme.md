# Earth-It

This project is from my freshman fall. It is the first large coding project I had taken on. File structure is all over the place :)

## Description
Earth-It is an Online Multiplayer 2d Sandbox game, similar to Terraria or Minecraft.
Within the game, you can mine, build, craft and explore! The world is huge and by
exploring the caves, you can find iron, coal, and diamonds. With these items, craft
better tools that help you mine and attack better! Have fun exploring!

To run the project, you will need to open three terminal windows on Mac. You will need all
the files in one location, such as your Desktop. From there, navigate to your desktop
in all three terminals. First execute the Server File by entering "python3 earth_server_test.py"
You should see the command "Waiting for a connection, Server Started" pop up. Next, enter
"python3 earth_client_test.py" into the next two Terminal Windows. You should now have
a working game.

You will need to install pygame https://www.pygame.org/download.shtml to be able to run these files.
This is the only library you will need to install because Sockets should be already installed.

There are a couple of shortcuts in the game that allow you to do more. Pressing "c" will bring up a
couple of the blocks in the game that you can use to craft. Pressing "t" will bring up tools
that you can use. On top of this, you can press "l" to print up coal and sticks to craft torhes.
To exit the chest or crafting, press "e". To destroy blocks, hold down the right mouse button.
To place blocks, select the item from the hotbar using the number pad and then press the left mouse
button. You can also use the right mouse button to attack the enemy.
